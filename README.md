# MySoftware

1. Create a new Repository called “MySoftware”

2. Have 3 branches in your repository:
 		Master (already exist- no reason to create)
 		NewButton
 		NewScreen

3. In your NewButton branch add a method called click() which
prints the word “Click”

4. In your NewScreen branch create a method called welcome()
which prints “New Screen”

5. Commit and push your changes into your branches.

6. Create a pull request from both branches into your Master

7. Merge your code

8. Go back to one of your Jenkins build jobs, and add this git
repository commits as a trigger (Poll SCM should be every 30
minutes).
